## About this Repository

This repository contains the source code for the TechSupportIq Webchat within our product. It is divided into multiple sub-projects:

- `webchat-ui`: contains the source code used to render the webchat and webchat-plugins via `react`.
- `webchat`: makes use of `webchat-ui` and adds the socket connection as well as state management to it. It can be used within React applications for seamless integration.
- `webchat-embed`: takes the `webchat` and renders it into a website without further manual integration into an existing React application.
- `plugins`: contains built-in webchat-plugins that can be understood as a basic feature set.

## Building your Webchat

You need an installed version of `Node.js` to build your Webchat. Clone this repository, then run `npm i` and `npm run bundle` within the root folder to install dependencies and create bundle files in `dist/`.

## Development

For development purposes, you can utilize `npm run dev`. This command spawns an HTTP server on port 8080, showcasing the current form of the webchat directly from the source code. It automatically reloads upon updating source files, simplifying the development process.
It automatically reloads when you make changes, streamlining the development process.

## Compatibility Builds

The `npm run bundle` command generates bundle files for the Webchat itself and basic Webchat plugins. Additionally, it produces a second version of each bundle ending in `.legacy.js`. These builds maintain the same feature set as the regular ones but are converted into an older JavaScript standard, enhancing compatibility for older browsers that lack support for modern JavaScript features, such as Internet Explorer 11.
